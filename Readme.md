# Calculator with Lexer, Parser, and Evaluator

This Python program is a basic calculator that can handle single-line mathematical expressions. It features a lexer, parser, and evaluator, and it utilizes the visitor pattern for abstract syntax tree (AST) traversal. Additionally, it offers a convenient way to visualize the AST using the Graphviz extension for Visual Studio Code.

## Usage

### Adding Code

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open the `calc.py` file in your code editor.

2. Locate the `code` variable within the file.

3. Assign your mathematical expression as a string to the `code` variable. For example:

```python
code = 'x = 4 + e;'
```


# Make sure to modify the code variable to represent the mathematical expression you want to evaluate.

## Running the Program

After setting the code variable, you can run the program using a Python interpreter:


python calc.py

The program will parse the input code, build an AST, evaluate the expression, and print the result to the console.

## Visualizing the AST

This program also provides a way to visualize the generated AST using the Graphviz extension for Visual Studio Code. To create a visualization, follow these steps:

1. Run the program as described in the "Running the Program" section.

2. The AST will be printed as a DOT format string in the console. Copy the entire output.

3. Open the Dot.dot file in your code editor. This file should have been generated by the program.

4. Paste the copied DOT format string into the Dot.dot file. Save the changes.

5. Ensure you have the Graphviz extension for Visual Studio Code installed.

6. In your code editor, open the Dot.dot file and press Ctrl+Shift+R to render the DOT file into an image.

7. The rendered image of the AST will be saved to the same directory with the same name as the Dot.dot file but with a different extension. For example, Dot.png.

## How It Works

- Lexer: The program uses a lexer to tokenize the input code. It identifies numbers, functions, constants, identifiers, and operators.

- Parser: The parser generates an AST from the tokenized input code using a grammar. It recognizes different types of expressions and creates corresponding nodes in the AST.

- Evaluator (Visitor Pattern): The evaluator (in this case, the Eval class) implements the visitor pattern to traverse the AST. It performs the actual evaluation of the mathematical expressions by visiting different nodes in the tree and computing the final result.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Sly (Lexer)
- Graphviz (AST Visualization)

## Graphviz Extension

To visualize the AST, make sure you have the Graphviz extension for Visual Studio Code installed. This extension allows you to render DOT files into images for easy visualization.
